# Dietary Patterns and COVID-19: Does what you eat affect your response to the novel coronavirus?

Project done in R to see if there exists any correlation between one's diet and their susceptivity to the novel coronavirus (i.e. death/infection/recovery rates).

Data used consisted of aggregates for protein/fat/energy intake of 23 food categories within several demographic groups in 170 countries.

This project was done in collaboration with [Ananya Nair](https://github.com/nairaaa09).
